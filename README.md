# HR-Analytics

📊 Project Overview:
The aim of this dashboard is to provide organizations with clear insights that can help improve employee engagement and reduce attrition.
🔄 Data Import and Cleaning:
I imported the HR analytics data into Power BI Desktop, ensuring it was accurate and reliable.
Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
I built a data model in Power Pivot to create relationships between tables, which helped in analyzing the data efficiently.
